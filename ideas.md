# Cool ideas
- Have a way to specify slow-mo intervals by previewing the current row
  - E.g. go to that row, press space, which then play starting from that row and then you hit a hotkey (say `m`) for slow-mo interval toggle.
  - You need a good way to compute the approximate duration to adjust various anchors
  - May need to hide this data from the spreadsheet (hidden columns)
  - May need an extra column to show the actual duration of the row
